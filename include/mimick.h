/* Documentation concepts */

/**
 * @defgroup symbol_target_string Symbol target strings
 * @ingroup general_concepts
 * @{
 *
 * Symbol target strings are strings of the form `"symbol_name(@scope)?"`,
 * i.e. a valid C identifier followed by an optional scope.
 *
 * A scope specifies the module where the function is mocked. Valid values
 * are either:
 *
 * 1. `self` which always refers to the main executable. Not specifying a
 *    scope is equivalent to using the `self` scope.
 *
 *    Regardless of the scope, the function is always mocked in the main
 *    executable, `self` only specifies that it shall only be mocked there.
 *
 * 2. Values of the form `selector:value`, where `selector` is one of `file`,
 *    `lib`, or `sym`.
 *
 *    1. If the `file` selector is specified, then `value` is interpreted as a
 *       full path and the scope is the loaded module at this specific path.
 *
 *    2. If the `lib` selector is specified, then `value` is interpreted as a
 *       name, and the scope is the loaded module with this name.
 *
 *       Note: This resolves differently between platforms and is the
 *          platform-independent way of specifying a library:
 *
 *          - On Linux, this resolves to a loaded library named `lib<value>.so`.
 *          - On Windows, this finds a loaded library named `<value>.dll`.
 *          - On Darwin, this finds a loaded library named `lib<value>.dylib`.
 *
 *    3. If the `sym` selector is specified, then `value` is interpreted as a
 *       symbol name, and the scope is the first loaded module defining this
 *       symbol.
 *
 * Examples:
 *
 *    * "foo": Mock the `foo` function in the main executable only.
 *
 *    * "foo@self": Same as `foo`
 *
 *    * "foo@file:/lib/libbar.so": Mock the `foo` function in `/lib/libbbar.so`.
 *
 *    * "foo@lib:bar": Mock the `foo` function in the `bar` library.
 *
 *    * "foo@sym:bar": Mock the `foo` function in the first loaded library that
 *      defines `bar`.
